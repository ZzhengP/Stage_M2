# Stage_M2

some examples for using ORCA (https://github.com/syroco/orca) and TRAXXS(https://github.com/akeolab/traxxs).
I recommend to use catkin workspace for building this project (http://wiki.ros.org/fr/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage). It's simply a lot to manage. 
In these samples, you can find how to define a task and constraint for the roboot. 
# orca_dev (this is a branch of ORCA)
The repository "orca_dev" is the simulation about KUKA LWR 4+, you can find example like:
   * adding a regularisation task.
   * adding an aiming task.
   * adding an energy constraint.
   * create a trajectory by using TRAXXS. 
# rtt_orca(https://github.com/syroco/rtt_orca)
The repository "rtt_orca" is OROCOS wrappers for the orca project. It allows the communication with the real robot.
